CONTENTS: The Java code is based on 3 files: 
Compo (to plot the position of Titan using 3rd order Runge-Kutta method and the theoritical position),
Resit (main code, contains RungeKutta, the theoritical solution and the different types of error) 
and Titan (permits to construct a Titan object composed of x and y postions and velocities).
	  The Matlab code is based on one file named Code_Resit_Project_12.m

To run the java program you need to compile and run Resit.java
